# hello-world
This is my repository as required by my Instructor.
My name is David Moreno, and I am a DePaul student. I walk dogs for a living. I am really enjoying MIS-250. The instructor imbeds a lot of video game, and pop-culture references into his assignments. I am a huge Metroid fan, so it makes me really happy to see Metroid references in the quizzes. Thanks for reading!
